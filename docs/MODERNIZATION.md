# Modernization report

Branch: `modernize`, based on upstream `e5bc6b9`.

## Phase 0 — setup

Isolated Linux checkout: `/home/shane/elgato-gchd-modernize`. The shared
Windows drive rejects Git chmod operations. Origin is ShaneKent/elgato-gchd;
upstream pushes are disabled. Reference remotes: ff5, eddyv73, upstream/dev.
Ubuntu 24.04, WSL 2 kernel 6.18.58.1, GCC 13.3, Clang 18.1, CMake 3.28,
libusb 1.0.27. Original Elgato 0fd9:0044 enumerated through lsusb.
Firmware binaries and downloaded installers are excluded from Git.

Hardware enumeration alone does not establish working firmware or capture.

## Phase 1 — build and CI

GCC 13 and Clang 18 strict builds pass, including Clang ASan/UBSan.
Regression suites cover CLI errors, resolution and address parsing, PAT/PMT/SIT
and descriptor generation. Constructor order, missing cstdint (credit PR #55),
ptr_fun, uninitialized state/descriptor fields, polymorphic destructors fixed.
CMake uses imported libusb, target options, install rules, and CTest.
Compared eddyv73 CMake (MIT); no fork code copied. CI gates correctness and
portability cppcheck diagnostics; performance suggestions are outside this gate.

## Phase 2 — USB robustness

Defects 1–4 fixed: initialized and checked streaming lengths/status, partial
timeout data retained, overflow data discarded, fatal errors propagated.
Explicit libusb context, auto detach/reattach, interface ownership tracked.
Already-active USB configurations are preserved.
Only successful configuration sets initialized; partial configuration does not
attempt the full shutdown protocol. Cleanup never throws, skips removed devices,
and has a five-second budget plus at most one in-flight transfer.
Control, interrupt and firmware transfers use 1000 ms timeouts; polling loops
check cancellation with 15-second/2000-attempt limits. Firmware I/O and every
upload chunk are checked (no spurious zero-length final transfer).
Additive --reset performs a USB reset and exits; WSL may need reattach.
Mock fault tests cover timeout, overflow, I/O, disconnect, short/missing firmware,
interruption and non-throwing destruction. Actual upload-timeout and initialization
interruption behavior were subsequently tested; see Phase 8.

## Phase 3 — firmware

Added --firmware-dir (highest priority), GCHD_FIRMWARE_DIR, then system/Mac
paths. Explicit overrides are exclusive, and implicit current-directory search
is removed. Runtime verifies SHA-256 and exact length before each upload, on
the same open file. OpenSSL Crypto is now a build dependency.

Both approved official installers were downloaded over HTTPS and extracted
with 7z successfully. Eight versioned size/hash records are in
[firmware-hashes.json](firmware-hashes.json); H57/H58 files match across both
installers, M01 files differ. get-firmware.sh pins installer hashes, accepts
only the approved URLs or their exact local installers, verifies all four
files before installation, and was tested end-to-end for DMG and MSI.
The optional dmg2img fallback is untested. No firmware/installer is in Git.

## Phase 4 — output safety

Defects 5–11 fixed. Explicit existing FIFO/file/symlink paths are preserved on
creation failure; only the created inode is unlinked. Default FIFO uses a
validated private XDG_RUNTIME_DIR or /tmp/gchd-UID directory with mode 0600,
O_NOFOLLOW and an advisory lock. Safe stale default FIFOs can be reused.
Writes handle partial writes/EINTR/EAGAIN; EPIPE, disk-full and UDP errors
propagate. UDP datagrams are never split on short writes. Socket connection
tries all addresses, frees addrinfo, and defaults to loopback as a destination.
Signal handlers only set sig_atomic_t; SIGHUP included, second signal _exit.
SIGPIPE disposition and masks are initialized. PID fd sentinel corrected.

A 256-buffer queue (at most 4 MiB plus in-flight buffers) and writer thread
separate synchronous USB reads from output latency. Saturation drops newest
buffers and counts losses; shutdown allows two seconds to drain before
cancelling nonblocking pipe/socket writes. A blocked kernel write to a regular
file on an unresponsive filesystem cannot be forcibly cancelled by this design.
Tests verify preserved files/symlinks, FIFO modes/cleanup, 1 MiB partial pipe
writes, EPIPE, /dev/full, bounded queue saturation/failure and SIGHUP.

## Phase 5 — CLI recording

Added gchd -, -o -, and -of stdout; only the selected sink is written.
Stdout is binary-only, rejects terminals, and restores pipe flags on close.
--duration accepts positive seconds or s/m/h suffixes and counts time after
initialization. Five-second stderr stats and final stats report USB/output
bytes, bitrate, dropped buffers/bytes, USB overflows and timeouts.
Help reflects runtime FIFO paths, hides disabled PID/frame-rate flags, and
adds input-no-stretch while preserving no-input-stretch. Numeric parsing
rejects non-finite/overflow values before unsafe casts. A related H.264 level
conversion swapped modf outputs; level 4.1 now converts to 41 correctly.
Tests include stdout byte fidelity and timed mocked streaming.

## Phase 6 — non-root use

Defect 12 fixed: udev appends elgato_gchd and uaccess tags, retaining the video
group/mode 0660 fallback. CMake installs the rule in an architecture-independent
lib/udev/rules.d directory; GCHD_UDEV_RULES_DIR can select /etc/udev/rules.d.
The video-group rule was installed and triggered by the user on WSL, and
non-root access persisted across subsequent reattachments. Desktop uaccess
seat ACLs remain unverified. A manual permission fallback is documented for
WSL environments without udev.

## Phase 7 — documentation and recording wrapper

README and WSL2.md document build, official firmware extraction, non-root use,
new FIFO location, stdout/ffmpeg recording, reset and attach behavior. Windows
commands are separated into one-time admin bind and recurring non-admin attach.
No Windows commands were executed in this modernization task.

gchd-record.sh forwards stop signals as SIGINT to the driver, waits for EOF and
ffmpeg container finalization, refuses existing output, and checks both child
exit statuses. TS/MKV use stream copy; MP4/MOV preserve video and encode AAC audio.
Synthetic ffmpeg H.264/MPEG-audio fixtures verified MKV stream copy, MP4/AAC
output, stop forwarding and finalization, overwrite refusal, and cleanup after
a forced ffmpeg error. This is not a hardware capture test.

## Phase 8 — hardware testing: recording not yet working

Original card: 0fd9:0044, revision V1100090. User reports HDMI around 480p and
confirmed video/audio preview in the official Windows app. Firmware from the
approved Mac 2.0.3 installer passed size/hash validation before each upload.
Tests ran as the regular Linux user after granting video-group access.

| Test | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| First guarded capture | Firmware upload timed out; exit 1 in 1.03 s, zero stream bytes |
| Warm retry | Device-state wait expired; exit 1 in 9.13 s, zero bytes |
| gchd --reset | Returned 0 in 0.28 s; device remained attached |
| Capture after reset | State wait still failed; reset did not restore firmware readiness |
| Physical power cycle, diagnostic capture | First idle-firmware chunk: offset 0, requested 16384, transferred 0; timeout and exit 1 in 1.14 s |
| SIGINT during real initialization | Clean interrupted-error exit 1, approximately 4 ms after SIGINT; no abort |
| Official Windows preview then close/reattach | First idle-firmware chunk still timed out; zero stream bytes |
| Preserve already-active USB configuration | Mock tests pass; real warm-start comparison still failed at first firmware chunk |
| Persistent udev rule | root:video 0660 and regular-user USB access observed after reattachments |

No successful firmware upload, valid 30-second recording, or real stream has
been observed. Streaming Ctrl+C/restart, unplug during streaming, loss counts
and 30+ minute USB/IP recording remain unverified. Partial upload errors can
leave the card waiting for a state transition; USB reset did not recover that
condition in this test. A reliable recovery guarantee has not been achieved.

Added focused diagnostics for firmware offsets/lengths and named hardware
waits. USB setup now preserves an already-active configuration, avoiding the
lightweight reset documented by libusb; this did not solve the observed upload
failure. Mock tests cover configuration selection and deadline/attempt bounds.

Sanitized results: [hardware-results-2026-11-11.json](hardware-results-2026-11-11.json).
Full logs remain locally under artifacts/ and are excluded from Git. The other
agent's upstream-only logs in the shared workspace were preserved unchanged.

The failure is before HDMI detection or bulk-IN streaming. There is no evidence
that input resolution or async receive queues would fix it. The current evidence
does not distinguish an unofficial-driver boot-protocol mismatch from USB/IP
transport behavior. The next useful comparison is official Windows startup USB
requests versus the WSL startup. Windows ETW/Logman is available and can collect
headers/status without installing a driver or restarting. USBPcap is optional,
not a prerequisite. No new Windows capture driver has been installed.

Native Windows preview was performed by the user. Subsequent agent Windows
commands were explicitly approved inventory/provider checks only; no trace or
attachment change has been performed by the agent as of this report.

Additional fixes: explicit libusb context and automatic kernel-driver reattach;
firmware override/hash checks and no implicit cwd search; resolution/numeric
validation; matching CLI help and alias; PID descriptor sentinel.

Deferred/out of scope: V4L2/v4l2loopback, multi-card support, upstream dev merge,
analog fixes, HD60/HD60 S, mode detection, source changes on the fly, and
sub-480i inputs. The large protocol configuration class remains for later work.
